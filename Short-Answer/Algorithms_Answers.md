a) O(n)-- one loop


b)O(n log n)-- nesed loop


c)O(n)-- recursive 

## Exercise II
Start on the floor= 0
Find top floor
Go to the middle floor 
Repeat the below until you find floor CHK.
	Drop the egg.
	If it breaks, move to the middle floor beteween where you are and the ground floor
	If it doesn't break, move to the middle floor between where you are and the top floor
	After finding the highest floor the egg doesn't break on, that's floor CHK
